# British Record Shop Archive

This is the code for the new (well it's new at the moment) British Record Shop Archive.

The BRSA is a volunteer effort to chronical the UK's record shops.

It is very much a work in progress and we're always on the look out for help.

Feel free to add issues and requests - we can't guarantee we'll get to them soon but we'll do our best.
